According to this documentation https://wiki.wesnoth.org/GettextForTranslators I used po files for translations.
After this message https://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?p=656238#p656238 I switched to mo files (compiled version of po files)
To prevent potential clashing with the po file structure I renamed the folder with po files, so it won't be used by the game.


Folder structure for the po files:
translations/wesnoth-Captured_by_a_Nightmare/ru.po

Folder structure for the mo files:
translations/ru/LC_MESSAGES/wesnoth-Captured_by_a_Nightmare.mo
